#### Henry Oliver

This is a parody of a game called the stanley parable, inside this game is another game. In this parody of that game, you are the baby and must crawl away from danger. You control his movement with the W A S D keys and if he reaches the fire you fail. It's a very meaningful game all about the desperation and tedium of endlessly confronting the demands of family life. I think the art world will really take notice. But of course the message of the game only becomes clear after you have been playing it for four hours. So why don't you give it four hours of play to make sure it is effective. Be sure to keep notes on your experience.

#### Make sure to enable audio

### There are two modes of play:

Normal - Play for four hours without dying to win

Easy Mode - Play for five minutes without dying to win, you can also press "p" to win
